# Pursuit-Evasion-game

### In this project, we explore a multi-agent reinforcement learning setup where a police agent attempts to catch a thief agent in a 2D grid-based environment. The agents learn opposing objectives: the police maximizes catching efficiency, while the thief learns evasion strategies. For the experiment, we will be using four cases, Police agent trained on PPO/DQN and Thief agent trained on PPO/DQN. We investigate how these policies evolve with time under well-crafted reward signals. Performance is evaluated using episode-based reward trends. The results demonstrate contrasting learning patterns, strategy emergence, and generalization capabilities of both agents.
